				<p>Note that this WIFI network is intended for the explicit purpose of engaging with the vuExposed installation on the first floor of the Vanderbilt University Wond'ry (hereafter: Wond'ry). If you want to access the general open WIFI for purposes outside of interacting with the exhibit, consult the front desk. By constenting or using this WIFI network, you agree to allow Jared Moore and any of his delegates  at the Wond'ry to temporarily monitor and modify your network traffic when connected to the vuExposed WIFI for, but not limited to, the illustrative purposes as described on the <a href="https://jlcmoore.github.io/vuExposed">project website</a>
